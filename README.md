# Concise Video Game Data Enhancement

This project enhances a basic video game dataset by adding three new informative fields using the Google AI Studio API:

- **Genre**: Single-word classification based on the game title.
- **Short Description**: A concise description of the game in under 30 words.
- **Player Mode**: Classification of gameplay mode into "Singleplayer", "Multiplayer", or "Both".

## ðŸ”„ Process Overview

1. **Data Loading**:
   - The script loads a CSV file containing game titles and their thumbnail image URLs.

2. **Genre Classification**:
   - Each game's title is processed to generate a **single-word** genre label.
   - Examples:
     - "Call of Duty" â†’ "Shooter"
     - "FIFA 23" â†’ "Sports"

3. **Short Description Generation**:
   - A brief summary of each game is generated using a limit of 30 words.
   - Descriptions are designed to be short, informative, and not include the game title.

4. **Player Mode Identification**:
   - The script determines the player mode based on the game title, returning one of the following:
     - "Singleplayer"
     - "Multiplayer"
     - "Both"

5. **Data Processing with Resume Support**:
   - Supports resuming processing in case of failure or interruption.
   - Incorporates backoff handling for API rate limits.

6. **Output**:
   - The final DataFrame includes new columns: `genre`, `short_description`, and `player_mode`.
   - Results are saved to a new CSV file: `Enhanced_Game_Thumbnail_Final.csv`.
